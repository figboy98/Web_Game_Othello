# Web Game Othello

This assignment was made for the course unit of Web Technologies of the Integrated Master of Science in Network Engineering and Information Systems 
from Faculty of Sciencs of University of Porto. https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=870&pv_ano_lectivo=2020


The project was made by FÃ¡bio Miguel Gomes Silva and Maria Eduarda Dantas

The expected final result was a web version of the Othello game, with the option to play locally and with other players.

In our project we didn't finished all of the backend implementation, so most calls are being made to a implementations given by the teacher.

The server with that implementation is no longer running
